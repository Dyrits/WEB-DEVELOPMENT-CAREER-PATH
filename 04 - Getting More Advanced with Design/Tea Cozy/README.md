## [CODE]CADEMY PRO | WEB DEVELOPMENT CAREER PATH > Getting More Advanced with Design > Tea Cozy
### Description of the project by [code]cademy
In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

The images and design spec you need to complete the project are listed below.
