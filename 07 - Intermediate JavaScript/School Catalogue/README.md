### Description of the project by [CODE]CADEMY PRO
Let’s put your knowledge of classes to the test by creating a digital school catalog for the New York City Department of Education. The Department of Education wants the catalog to hold quick reference material for each school in the city.

We need to create classes for primary, middle, and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent `School` class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:

#### School
- **Properties**: `name` (string), `level` (one of three strings: `'primary'`, `'middle'`, or `'high'`), and `numberOfStudents` (number)  
- **Getters**: all properties have getters  
- **Setters**: the `numberOfStudents` property has a setter  
- **Methods**: `.quickFacts()` and `.pickSubstituteTeacher()` (this is a static method)  

#### Primary
- Includes everything in the `School` class, plus one additional property  
- **Properties**: `pickupPolicy` (string)  

#### Middle
- Does not include any additional properties or methods  

#### High
- Includes everything in the `School` class, plus one additional property  
- **Properties**: `sportsTeams` (array of strings)  

If you’re looking for a challenge, create the `constructor()` and getters for the four classes above. Then, use the setter and methods specifications in steps five, six, and seven to finish the project.
